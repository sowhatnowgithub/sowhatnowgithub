# 😷🇮🇳🙏 Hey, I'm Sowhatnow 
**Tech Hobbyist (Luckily not looking for job in tech 😙)**
## "sowhatnow" means *so what, now?*  
Always questioning what comes after "this" or "that".  
Eventually **realising**, not **realized**  — there is only **now**.  
(*Thanks, Eckhart Tolle.*)

### 🫣 I Know for a Fact

> If someone (X) can achieve something remarkable — Event (Y) —  
> and that achievement is recognized as great by others (Z),  
> then it follows that Z, being human, also carries the **capacity** and **possibility**  
> — even if just a fraction — to do something like Event (Y).

**Example:**  
There goes someone swimming 10 km.  
Then we can be *damn sure* everyone has the potential and capacity  
to swim even 10 meters.


### 😌 Quote That Stuck with Me

> *"I was afraid of people judging me. I always was.  
But then I realized — all the things I’m insecure about, afraid they’ll see?  
They’re just doing a  better job at hiding their own insecurities than I am."*  
> — David Goggins


### 🤨 What I Learned

> I don’t see reality —  
> **I see what I want to see.**  
> I always did.

No one’s special unless *I* make them special.  
Put someone on a pedestal, and it’s my mind doing the lifting — not their truth.

Judging others — whether for the good or the bad —  
says more about what I refuse to see in myself.

Keep doing that, and I fall into a ditch  
**of my own making.**
