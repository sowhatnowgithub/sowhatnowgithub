### 😌 Quote That Stuck with Me

> *"I was afraid of people judging me. I always was.  
But then I realized — all the things I’m insecure about, afraid they’ll see?  
They’re just doing a  better job at hiding their own insecurities than I am."*

### 🫣 I Know for a Fact

> If someone (X) can achieve something remarkable — Event (Y) —  
> and that achievement is recognized as great by others (Z),  
> then it follows that Z, being human, also carries the **capacity** and **possibility**  
> — even if just a fraction — to do something like Event (Y).

**Example:**  
There goes someone swimming 10 km.  
Then we can be *damn sure* everyone has the potential and capacity  
to swim even 10 meters.
